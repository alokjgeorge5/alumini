## üß™ Test Complete Workflow

### Workflow: Student Applies for Scholarship

#### 1. Student views eligible scholarships
```bash
TOKEN_STUDENT=$(curl -s -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"sarah@student.edu","password":"password123"}' \
  | jq -r '.access_token')

curl -s http://localhost:5000/api/scholarships/eligible \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN_STUDENT" | jq
```

#### 2. Student applies for Tech Innovation Scholarship (ID: 1)
```bash
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/scholarships/1/apply \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN_STUDENT" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "cover_letter": "I am passionate about technology and innovation. With a CGPA of 8.5 and multiple projects...",
    "additional_info": "GitHub: github.com/sarahwilson, Portfolio: sarahwilson.dev"
  }' | jq
```

Expected: `201 Created` (or `400 Bad Request` if already applied)

#### 3. Student checks application status
```bash
curl -s http://localhost:5000/api/scholarships/applications/my \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN_STUDENT" | jq
```

#### 4. Alumni views applications for their scholarship
```bash
TOKEN_ALUMNI=$(curl -s -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"alice@alumni.edu","password":"password123"}' \
  | jq -r '.access_token')

curl -s http://localhost:5000/api/scholarships/1/applications \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN_ALUMNI" | jq
```

**Expected response includes:**
- Student name, email, CGPA, category
- Application date and status
- Cover letter and additional info

#### 5. Alumni approves the application
```bash
# Get application ID from previous response, then:
curl -s -X PUT http://localhost:5000/api/scholarships/applications/1/status \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN_ALUMNI" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"status": "approved"}' | jq
```

#### 6. Student checks updated status
```bash
curl -s http://localhost:5000/api/scholarships/applications/my \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN_STUDENT" | jq
```

Status should now be: `approved`

## üé® View Student Profile with Statistics

```bash
# Get detailed profile for Sarah (ID: 4)
curl -s http://localhost:5000/api/users/4 | jq
```

**Expected response includes:**
```json
{
  "id": 4,
  "name": "Sarah Wilson",

  "scholarship_applications_count": 1,
  "job_applications_count": 1,
  "mentorship_requests_count": 1,
  "created_at": "2024-..."
}
```

## üîç Explore the Database

### Connect to MySQL
```bash
docker exec -it $(docker ps -qf "name=db") mysql -u alumni_user -palumni_pass alumni_connect
```

### Run Sample Queries

#### 1. View all students with their CGPA
```sql
SELECT id, name, email, cgpa, category FROM users WHERE role = 'student';
```

#### 2. See scholarship eligibility matching
```sql
SELECT
    s.title,
    s.cgpa_requirement,
    s.category_requirement,
    COUNT(sa.id) as total_applications
FROM scholarships s
LEFT JOIN scholarship_applications sa ON s.id = sa.scholarship_id
WHERE s.status = 'active'
GROUP BY s.id, s.title, s.cgpa_requirement, s.category_requirement;
```

#### 3. Complex JOIN - Students with applications
```sql
SELECT
    u.name as student_name,
    u.cgpa,
    u.category,
    s.title as scholarship_title,
    s.amount,
    sa.status,
    sa.application_date
FROM users u
JOIN scholarship_applications sa ON u.id = sa.student_id
JOIN scholarships s ON sa.scholarship_id = s.id
ORDER BY sa.application_date DESC;
```

#### 4. Aggregation - Average CGPA by category
```sql
SELECT
    category,
    COUNT(*) as student_count,
    AVG(cgpa) as avg_cgpa,
    MIN(cgpa) as min_cgpa,
    MAX(cgpa) as max_cgpa
FROM users
WHERE role = 'student' AND cgpa IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY category;
```

## üìä View Platform Statistics

```bash
TOKEN_ADMIN=$(curl -s -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"admin@alumni.edu","password":"password123"}' \
  | jq -r '.access_token')

curl -s http://localhost:5000/api/admin/dashboard \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN_ADMIN" | jq
```

**Expected statistics:**
```json
{
  "users": {
    "total_students": 2,
    "total_alumni": 2,
    "total_admins": 1,
    "total": 5
  },
  "opportunities": {
    "active": 3
  },
  "scholarships": {
    "active": 4,
    "total_applications": 2
  },
  "mentorships": {
    "pending": 2
  },
  "applications": {
    "total": 2
  }
}
```

## üö¶ Verify Role-Based Access Control

### Test 1: Student tries to create scholarship (should fail)
```bash
TOKEN_STUDENT=$(curl -s -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"sarah@student.edu","password":"password123"}' \
  | jq -r '.access_token')

curl -s -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/scholarships \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN_STUDENT" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"title":"Test","amount":1000}' | jq
```

**Expected:** `403 Forbidden` - "Access denied"

### Test 2: Alumni tries to access admin dashboard (should fail)
```bash
TOKEN_ALUMNI=$(curl -s -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"alice@alumni.edu","password":"password123"}' \
  | jq -r '.access_token')

curl -s http://localhost:5000/api/admin/dashboard \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN_ALUMNI" | jq
```

**Expected:** `403 Forbidden` - "Access denied"

## üõë Stop the Application

```bash
docker compose down
```

To completely reset (including database):
```bash
docker compose down -v
docker compose up --build
```

---

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### Database not ready
**Symptom:** Backend shows database connection errors

**Solution:** Wait 30-60 seconds for MySQL to fully initialize

### Port already in use
**Symptom:** Cannot start containers

**Solution:**
```bash
docker compose down
# Then start again
docker compose up --build
```

### Invalid token error
**Symptom:** API returns "Invalid token"

**Solution:** Token may have expired, login again to get a new token
